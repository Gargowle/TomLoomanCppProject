# TomLoomanCppProject
 
This project was built along the course **[Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine](https://courses.tomlooman.com)**.

The game assets are licensed for use with the Unreal Engine only. Without a custom license you cannot use them to create sequels, remasters, or otherwise emulate the original game or use the original game's trademarks, character names, or other IP to advertise or name your game. (Unreal Engine EULA applies) (Please note this applies to the Game Assets that refer to Epic's Paragon, you can still use the project code and content to build your own Unreal Engine game)
